# Data_Analytics_Project_Customer_Segmentation


# Goal of the Project

This project aims to perform Customer Segmentation Analysis for an automobile and bike company utilizing an RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) model. The RFM analysis categorizes customers based on their past purchase behavior, dividing them into 11 distinct segments. The objective is to identify target customer segments that can contribute to increased sales revenue. To complement this analysis, a Sales Dashboard for Customer Segmentation has been created using Tableau. Python is employed for data quality assessment and analysis.

## Tableau Dashboard
